# Bookmarker Website README
## Overview
This repository contains the code for a Bookmarker website that allows users to save website names and URLs for easy bookmarking. The website is built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript, and incorporates specific rules for validating user input when adding website names or URLs. The main features of the website include validation, event listeners, and DOM manipulation to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features
### Validation
The Bookmarker website includes robust validation mechanisms to ensure that users provide accurate and complete information when adding website names and URLs. This validation prevents users from submitting empty or invalid inputs, enhancing the overall reliability of the bookmarking process.

### Event Listeners
To create a dynamic user interface, event listeners are employed throughout the website. These event listeners respond to user actions such as button clicks or form submissions, triggering the necessary functions and updates to maintain a smooth and interactive experience.

### DOM Manipulation
The Document Object Model (DOM) is skillfully utilized to modify the website's content in real-time. When a user adds a new bookmark, the DOM is updated to reflect the changes immediately without the need for a page reload, ensuring a responsive and fluid user interface.

## Technologies Used
#### HTML5: 
Provides the structure and layout of the website, defining the various elements and their arrangement.

#### CSS3: 
Handles the styling and presentation of the website, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

#### Bootstrap 5: 
Utilized for responsive design, grid systems, and pre-built components that accelerate development.

#### JavaScript: 
Implements the interactivity and functionality of the website, including validation, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
